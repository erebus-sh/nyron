# nyron diff

Show commits since the last release for all or specific projects.

## Usage

### View all commits across all projects

```bash
npx @nyron/cli diff
```

### View commits for a specific project

```bash
npx @nyron/cli diff --prefix @my-pkg/sdk@
```

## Options

### `-f, --prefix <prefix>`

Filter commits by tag prefix. Only shows commits for the project with the specified prefix.

```bash
npx @nyron/cli diff --prefix v
```

## What It Shows

The `diff` command displays:

- All commits since the last tagged release
- Commits grouped by type (Features, Bug Fixes, Chores)
- Author information (if GitHub token is configured)
- Commit hashes and messages

This gives you a preview of what will be included in your next changelog.

## Examples

### Single package repository

```bash
npx @nyron/cli diff --prefix v
```

### Monorepo - specific package

```bash
npx @nyron/cli diff --prefix @myapp/api@
```

### Check all projects

```bash
npx @nyron/cli diff
```

## Use Cases

- Preview changes before creating a release
- Verify commits are following [conventional commit format](/docs/guides/conventional-commits)
- Decide on the appropriate version bump type (major, minor, patch)
- Review what will appear in the generated changelog

## Next Steps

After reviewing your commits:

- Use [`nyron bump`](/docs/commands/bump) to create a new version and changelog
- Learn about the [versioning workflow](/docs/guides/workflow)
