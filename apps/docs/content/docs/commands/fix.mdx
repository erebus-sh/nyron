# nyron fix

Validate and repair inconsistencies in your Nyron setup by checking configuration, metadata, and package files.

## Usage

```bash
npx @nyron/cli fix
```

This command scans your entire Nyron setup and automatically fixes most issues, prompting you only when manual intervention is needed.

## What It Does

The `fix` command performs a comprehensive validation of your Nyron setup in four phases:

### Phase 1: Detection

Scans for issues across your setup:

- **Path validation** - Checks if project directories exist
- **package.json validation** - Verifies all projects have valid package.json with required `version` field
- **Orphaned packages** - Finds packages in `meta.json` or `versions.json` that aren't in your config
- **Missing packages** - Finds packages in config that aren't in metadata files
- **Version mismatches** - Detects when package.json versions differ from meta.json versions

### Phase 2: Auto-fix

Automatically fixes issues without prompting:

- **Removes orphaned packages** from `meta.json` and `versions.json` (config is source of truth)
- **Adds missing packages** to `meta.json` and `versions.json` with their current versions
- **Syncs version mismatches** from `package.json` to `meta.json` (package.json is source of truth)

### Phase 3: Prompt for Path Issues

Asks for your input on filesystem issues:

- **Missing directories** - Prompts to create missing project directories with package.json
- **Missing package.json** - Prompts to create package.json with version 0.0.0
- **Invalid package.json** - Prompts to add missing `version` field

### Phase 4: Report

Shows a comprehensive summary of all fixes applied.

## When to Use

Run `nyron fix` when:

- You've manually edited `nyron.config.ts` and added/removed projects
- You suspect inconsistencies between your config and metadata files
- You're getting errors from other Nyron commands
- You've manually modified package versions
- You're setting up an existing project with Nyron

## Example Output

```bash
$ npx @nyron/cli fix

## No Issues Found

If everything is in good shape, you'll see:

```bash
üîç Scanning Nyron setup for issues...

‚úÖ No issues found! Your Nyron setup is in good shape.
```

## Configuration as Source of Truth

The `fix` command treats your `nyron.config.ts` as the single source of truth:

- If a package exists in config ‚Üí it's added to metadata files
- If a package doesn't exist in config ‚Üí it's removed from metadata files

For version conflicts, `package.json` is the source of truth and metadata is synced to match it.

## Best Practices

1. **Run after config changes** - Always run `fix` after editing `nyron.config.ts`
2. **Commit metadata changes** - After fixing, commit the updated `.nyron/` files
3. **Review before accepting** - Read the fix summary to understand what changed
4. **Safe to run anytime** - The command is non-destructive and prompts before creating files
