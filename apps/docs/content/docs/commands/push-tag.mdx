# nyron push-tag

Create and push nyron-release tags that trigger the automated release workflow.

## Usage

```bash
npx @nyron/cli push-tag
```

## What It Does

The `push-tag` command:

1. **Generates a unique nyron-release tag** with current timestamp
2. **Creates the git tag** locally  
3. **Pushes the tag** to the remote repository
4. **Updates meta.json** with the latest release tag
5. **Triggers automated workflows** that process the .nyron/ directory

## Tag Format

Nyron-release tags follow this format:
```
nyron-release@YYYY-MM-DD@HH-MM-SS.mmm
```

**Example:**
```
nyron-release@2024-01-15@14-30-25.123
```

This format ensures:
- **Chronological ordering** of releases
- **Unique timestamps** to avoid conflicts
- **Machine-readable** format for automated processing

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** Changes must be committed to git
- **Required:** `.nyron/` directory must contain version metadata (created by `bump` command)
- **Recommended:** Push permissions to the repository

## Typical Workflow

The `push-tag` command is used after bumping versions:

```bash
# 1. Bump version and generate changelog
npx @nyron/cli bump --type minor --prefix v

# 2. Commit changes  
git add .
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.0"

# 3. Create and push nyron-release tag
npx @nyron/cli push-tag

# 4. Create GitHub release
npx @nyron/cli release
```

## What Happens Next

After pushing a nyron-release tag:

1. **Automated workflows** can detect the new tag
2. **Version information** is extracted from .nyron/ directory  
3. **Changelog generation** becomes possible via `release` command
4. **Release automation** can process the accumulated changes

## Examples

### Basic usage

```bash
npx @nyron/cli push-tag
```

Sample output:
```
üè∑Ô∏è  Creating nyron-release tag...
‚úì Generated tag: nyron-release@2024-01-15@14-30-25.123
‚úì Tag created and pushed successfully
‚úÖ Updated meta.json with latest tag: nyron-release@2024-01-15@14-30-25.123
```

### After version bump

```bash
# Bump first
npx @nyron/cli bump --type minor --prefix v

# Commit the changes
git add .
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.0"  

# Push the nyron-release tag
npx @nyron/cli push-tag
```

## Understanding Nyron Tags

Nyron uses a dual-tag system:

### Project Tags (from bump command)
- Format: `v1.2.0`, `@pkg/name@1.2.0`  
- **Purpose:** Mark specific package versions
- **Created by:** `bump` command
- **Used for:** Version tracking, changelog boundaries

### Nyron-Release Tags (from push-tag command)  
- Format: `nyron-release@2024-01-15@14-30-25.123`
- **Purpose:** Trigger release automation
- **Created by:** `push-tag` command  
- **Used for:** Workflow triggers, release boundaries

## Error Handling

**Git not clean:**
```
Error: Working directory not clean
```
Commit your changes first before running `push-tag`.

**No .nyron/ directory:**
```
Error: No version metadata found
```
Run `nyron bump` first to generate version information.

**Push permission denied:**
```
Error: Permission denied (publickey)
```
Ensure you have push access to the repository.

## Integration with CI/CD

Nyron-release tags can trigger automated workflows:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/release.yml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'nyron-release@*'
      
jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Create Release
        run: npx @nyron/cli release
```
