# nyron release

Create GitHub releases with auto-generated changelogs based on commits between nyron-release tags.

## Usage

```bash
npx @nyron/cli release
```

### Preview changelog without creating release

```bash
npx @nyron/cli release --dry-run
```

### Skip tag creation (use existing tag)

```bash
npx @nyron/cli release -n
```

## Options

### `-d, --dry-run`

**Optional.** Preview the changelog without creating an actual GitHub release.

```bash
npx @nyron/cli release --dry-run
```

### `-n, --no-tag`

**Optional.** Skip creating a new nyron-release tag. Use this when:
- You already created a tag with `push-tag` command
- Running in CI/CD after tag was pushed locally
- You want to use a GPG-signed tag created manually

```bash
npx @nyron/cli release -n
```

**Example: Using with push-tag**

```bash
# Create GPG-signed tag locally
npx @nyron/cli push-tag

# Create release without creating another tag
npx @nyron/cli release -n
```

## How It Works

The `release` command works by:

1. **Finding the latest nyron-release tag** - Looks for tags like `nyron-release@2024-01-15@14-30-25.123`
2. **Fetching commits** since that tag to HEAD
3. **Parsing conventional commits** to extract features, fixes, and other changes
4. **Reading version information** from the .nyron/ directory
5. **Generating a changelog** in markdown format
6. **Creating a GitHub release** with the changelog as the description

## Prerequisites

- **Required:** A `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable must be set
- **Required:** At least one nyron-release tag must exist (created by `push-tag`)
- **Required:** Commits must follow [conventional commit format](/docs/guides/conventional-commits)

## What It Does

The release command:

- Creates a GitHub release on your repository
- Uses an auto-generated changelog as the release description
- Tags the release with a new nyron-release tag
- Groups commits by type (Features, Bug Fixes, Chores, etc.)
- Includes author information and commit links

## Examples

### Create a release

```bash
npx @nyron/cli release
```

### Preview what will be released

```bash
npx @nyron/cli release --dry-run
```

Sample output:
```
üìç Step 1: Finding latest release tag...
‚úì Found tag: nyron-release@2024-01-15@14-30-25.123

üìç Step 2: Fetching commits since last release...
‚úì Found 5 commit(s)

üìç Step 3: Parsing commits...
‚úì Parsed commits into groups (features, fixes, etc.)

üìç Step 4: Reading version information...
‚úì Loaded version data for 2 package(s)

üìç Step 5: Generating changelog...
‚úì Changelog generated (1,234 characters)

üìç Step 6: Preview (DRY RUN - no release created)

## Typical Workflow

### Manual Workflow

The `release` command is typically used as the final step:

```bash
# 1. Bump version and generate changelog
npx @nyron/cli bump --type minor --prefix v

# 2. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.0"

# 3. Create and push nyron-release tag
npx @nyron/cli push-tag

# 4. Create GitHub release
npx @nyron/cli release
```

### Automated Workflow (Recommended)

Alternatively, set up a GitHub Actions workflow to automatically run the `release` command when you push a nyron-release tag:

```bash
# 1. Bump and commit
npx @nyron/cli bump --type minor --prefix v
git add . && git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.0"

# 2. Push tag (triggers automated release)
npx @nyron/cli push-tag

# ‚ú® The GitHub release is created automatically by CI/CD!
```

This workflow requires a `.github/workflows/release.yml` file in your repository. See the [automated workflow guide](/docs/guides/workflow#automated-release-workflow) for setup instructions.

## Error Handling

**No nyron-release tag found:**
```
Error: No nyron release tag found
   ‚Üí Make sure to push the tag with nyron tool
```
Run `npx @nyron/cli push-tag` first.

**No commits found:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  No commits found between tags - skipping release
```
This means there are no new commits since the last release.

**Missing GitHub token:**
```
Error: GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable is required
```
Set your GitHub token in a `.env` file or environment variable.
