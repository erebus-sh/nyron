# Frequently Asked Questions

## Do I need to use conventional commits?

Yes. Nyron parses commit messages to generate changelogs. If your commits don't follow the `type(scope): message` format, they'll be grouped under "Other".

For the best experience, we recommend following the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Learn more in our [conventional commits guide](/docs/guides/conventional-commits).

## Can I use this without GitHub?

Not yet. Nyron currently depends on GitHub for repository metadata and enriched commit information (author links, avatars, commit URLs). Support for other platforms is planned.

## Does it work with monorepos?

Absolutely. Define multiple projects in your config with different `tagPrefix` values, and Nyron will track each independently.

Example configuration for a monorepo:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@nyron/cli/config"

export default defineConfig({
  repo: "your-org/monorepo",
  projects: {
    api: {
      tagPrefix: "@monorepo/api@",
      path: "packages/api",
    },
    sdk: {
      tagPrefix: "@monorepo/sdk@",
      path: "packages/sdk",
    },
  },
})
```

Each project will have its own version history and changelog.

## What if I don't have a GitHub token?

Nyron will still work, but changelogs won't include GitHub usernames, avatars, or commit URLs—just the git author name.

We recommend setting up a GitHub token for the best experience. See the [quickstart guide](/docs/getting-started/quickstart#setup-github-token-optional-but-recommended) for instructions.

## How do I change the changelog format?

Currently, Nyron uses a predefined changelog format based on conventional commits. Customizable templates are planned for future releases.

## Can I use Nyron with CI/CD?

Yes! You can integrate Nyron into your CI/CD pipeline. For example, you could automatically generate changelogs when merging to your main branch, or create releases when tags are pushed.

## What version of Node.js do I need?

Nyron is built to work with modern Node.js versions. We recommend Node.js 18 or higher, though it may work with earlier versions.

You can also use Bun, which is our recommended package manager for the best performance.

## How do I migrate from another versioning tool?

1. Install Nyron: `bun add -D @nyron/cli`
2. Initialize configuration: `npx @nyron/cli init`
3. Edit `nyron.config.ts` to match your existing tag format
4. Start using Nyron commands

Nyron will work with your existing git tags—just make sure the `tagPrefix` in your config matches your current tagging convention.
