# Quickstart

This guide will help you set up Nyron in your project and create your first automated release.

## Initialize Nyron

Run the initialization command to create a configuration file:

```bash
npx @nyron/cli init
```

This creates a `nyron.config.ts` file in your project root with the following structure:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@nyron/cli/config"

export default defineConfig({
  repo: "owner/repo", // Your GitHub repo
  projects: {
    sdk: {
      tagPrefix: "@my-package/sdk@",
      path: "packages/sdk",
    },
    service: {
      tagPrefix: "@my-package/service@",
      path: "apps/service",
    },
  },
  autoChangelog: true,
  onPushReminder: true,
})
```

**Edit this file** to match your project structure.

### Single-Package Repository

For a single-package repo, use this simpler configuration:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "@nyron/cli/config"

export default defineConfig({
  repo: "your-org/your-repo",
  projects: {
    main: {
      tagPrefix: "v",
      path: ".",
    },
  },
  autoChangelog: true,
  onPushReminder: true,
})
```

## Setup GitHub Token (Optional but Recommended)

For enriched changelogs with author links and commit URLs, set a GitHub token:

```bash
# Create .env in your project root
echo "GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token_here" > .env
```

Generate a token at [GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

<Callout type="info">
Without a GitHub token, Nyron will still work, but changelogs won't include GitHub usernames, avatars, or commit URLs—just the git author name.
</Callout>

## Start Using Nyron

Now you're ready to use Nyron! Here are some common commands to get started:

### See what commits you have since the last release

```bash
npx @nyron/cli diff
```

### Bump version and auto-generate changelog

```bash
npx @nyron/cli bump --type minor --prefix v
```

### Create and push a git tag

```bash
npx @nyron/cli tag --prefix v --version 1.2.0
```
