# Conventional Commits

Nyron uses the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to parse your commit history and generate meaningful changelogs.

## Commit Format

The conventional commit format follows this structure:

```
<type>(<scope>): <message>
```

### Components

- **Type**: The category of change (required)
- **Scope**: The area of the codebase affected (optional)
- **Message**: A brief description of the change (required)

### Examples

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login
fix(api): resolve memory leak in endpoint
docs: update installation guide
refactor(core): simplify error handling
```

## Supported Commit Types

Nyron recognizes and groups commits by the following types:

| Type | Group | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `feat` | **Features** | New features |
| `fix` | **Bug Fixes** | Bug fixes |
| `docs` | **Chores** | Documentation changes |
| `refactor` | **Chores** | Code refactoring |
| `perf` | **Chores** | Performance improvements |
| `test` | **Chores** | Test additions/changes |
| `chore` | **Chores** | Maintenance tasks |
| `style` | **Chores** | Code style changes |

## Changelog Grouping

Commits are organized into three main sections in the generated changelog:

### Features

All commits with type `feat` appear under the Features section:

```markdown
## Features
- **auth**: add OAuth2 login
- **dashboard**: implement real-time updates
```

### Bug Fixes

All commits with type `fix` appear under Bug Fixes:

```markdown
## Bug Fixes
- **api**: resolve memory leak in endpoint
- **ui**: fix button alignment issue
```

### Chores

All other types (`docs`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`, `style`) are grouped under Chores:

```markdown
## Chores
- **docs**: update API documentation
- **test**: add unit tests for auth module
```

## Best Practices

### Use descriptive scopes

Scopes help organize changes by area:

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login
fix(api): resolve memory leak
docs(readme): update installation steps
```

### Write clear messages

Messages should be concise and describe what changed:

✅ **Good:**
```
feat(auth): add password reset functionality
fix(api): prevent null pointer exception in user endpoint
```

❌ **Bad:**
```
feat: stuff
fix: bug
```

### Be consistent

Stick to lowercase for types and scopes, and use imperative mood for messages:

```
feat(core): add new feature
```

Not:
```
Feat(Core): Added new feature
```

## Non-Conventional Commits

If a commit doesn't follow the conventional format, Nyron will:

- Still include it in the changelog
- Group it under "Other" or "Chores"
- Use the full commit message as-is

For best results, ensure all commits follow the conventional format.

## Next Steps

- Learn [how Nyron works](/docs/guides/how-it-works) with these commits
- See a typical [versioning workflow](/docs/guides/workflow)
- Start using the [`diff` command](/docs/commands/diff) to preview your commits
