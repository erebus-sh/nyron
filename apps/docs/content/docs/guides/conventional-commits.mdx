# Conventional Commits

Nyron uses the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) to parse your commit history and generate meaningful changelogs.

## Commit Format

The conventional commit format follows this structure:

```
<type>(<scope>): <message>
```

### Components

- **Type**: The category of change (required)
- **Scope**: The area of the codebase affected (optional)
- **Message**: A brief description of the change (required)

### Examples

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login
fix(api): resolve memory leak in endpoint
docs: update installation guide
refactor(core): simplify error handling
```

## Supported Commit Types

Nyron recognizes and groups commits by the following types:

| Type | Group | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `feat` | **Features** | New features |
| `fix` | **Bug Fixes** | Bug fixes |
| `docs` | **Chores** | Documentation changes |
| `refactor` | **Chores** | Code refactoring |
| `perf` | **Chores** | Performance improvements |
| `test` | **Chores** | Test additions/changes |
| `chore` | **Chores** | Maintenance tasks |
| `style` | **Chores** | Code style changes |

## Changelog Grouping

Commits are organized into three main sections in the generated changelog:

### Features

All commits with type `feat` appear under the Features section:

```markdown
## Features
- **auth**: add OAuth2 login
- **dashboard**: implement real-time updates
```

### Bug Fixes

All commits with type `fix` appear under Bug Fixes:

```markdown
## Bug Fixes
- **api**: resolve memory leak in endpoint
- **ui**: fix button alignment issue
```

### Chores

All other types (`docs`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`, `style`) are grouped under Chores:

```markdown
## Chores
- **docs**: update API documentation
- **test**: add unit tests for auth module
```

## Best Practices

### Use descriptive scopes

Scopes help organize changes by area:

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 login
fix(api): resolve memory leak
docs(readme): update installation steps
```

### Write clear messages

Messages should be concise and describe what changed:

✅ **Good:**
```
feat(auth): add password reset functionality
fix(api): prevent null pointer exception in user endpoint
```

❌ **Bad:**
```
feat: stuff
fix: bug
```

### Be consistent

Stick to lowercase for types and scopes, and use imperative mood for messages:

```
feat(core): add new feature
```

Not:
```
Feat(Core): Added new feature
```

## Non-Conventional Commits

If a commit doesn't follow the conventional format, Nyron will:

- Still include it in the changelog
- Group it under "Other" or "Chores"
- Use the full commit message as-is

For best results, ensure all commits follow the conventional format.

## GitHub Repository Setup

To maintain a clean, linear, and machine-readable git history compatible with changelog automation, your GitHub repository should follow the setup below.

### Required GitHub Settings

**Settings → General → Pull Requests**

| Option | State | Why |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Allow merge commits | ❌ Disabled | Prevents messy "Merge pull request #…" commits that break commit parsing and clutter history. |
| Allow squash merging | ✅ Enabled | Produces one clean commit per PR. **Important:** Change "Default commit message" dropdown from "Default message" to "Pull request title" so the PR title becomes the commit message. |
| Allow rebase merging | ✅ Enabled (optional) | Maintains linear history if granular commits are needed. |

**Settings → Branches → Branch protection rules**

This is optional but strongly recommended for production repositories:

| Rule | State | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| Require pull request before merging | ✅ | Ensures review and title validation. |
| Require status checks to pass | ✅ | Prevents broken or unlinted commits from landing. |
| Require linear history | ✅ | Enforces a flat, merge-free commit tree. |
| Include administrators | ✅ | Prevents accidental overrides. |
| Disallow force pushes | ✅ | Protects commit history integrity. |

### PR Title Conventions

All PR titles must follow the **Conventional Commit** format.
This ensures changelogs are generated automatically and correctly.

```
type(scope): description (#PR)
```

**Examples:**

```
feat(api): add realtime pub/sub (#42)
fix(auth): correct token refresh (#77)
docs: clarify environment variable setup
chore: update dependencies (#88)
```

<Callout type="info">
When you squash merge a PR, GitHub uses the PR title as the commit message. This means your PR title becomes the commit message that Nyron parses for changelog generation. Make sure your PR titles follow the conventional commit format!
