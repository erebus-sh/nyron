# How It Works

Nyron reads your Git history and parses **conventional commits** to generate structured changelogs automatically.

## The Process

Nyron follows a systematic approach to generate your changelogs:

### 1. Fetches commits

Nyron retrieves all commits since your last tagged release for the specified project.

### 2. Filters out meta commits

Version bumps, changelog updates, and other meta commits are automatically excluded from the changelog.

### 3. Parses conventional commit syntax

Each commit is analyzed to extract:
- **Type**: The category of change (feat, fix, docs, etc.)
- **Scope**: The area of the codebase affected (optional)
- **Message**: The description of the change

### 4. Groups commits

Commits are organized into meaningful categories:
- **Features**: New functionality
- **Bug Fixes**: Bug fixes and corrections
- **Chores**: Maintenance, documentation, refactoring

### 5. Enriches with GitHub data

If a GitHub token is configured, Nyron adds:
- Author usernames and links
- Author avatars
- Commit URLs linking to GitHub

### 6. Generates markdown

The final output is formatted as clean, readable markdown suitable for changelogs.

## Example Output

Here's what a generated changelog section looks like:

```markdown
## Features
- **auth**: add OAuth2 login ([@username](https://github.com/username)) [[a1b2c3d](https://github.com/owner/repo/commit/a1b2c3d)]

## Bug Fixes
- **api**: resolve memory leak in endpoint ([@username](https://github.com/username)) [[e4f5g6h](https://github.com/owner/repo/commit/e4f5g6h)]
```

## What Makes It Work

### Conventional Commits

Nyron relies on the [conventional commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). This standardized format allows Nyron to:

- Automatically categorize changes
- Generate meaningful changelogs
- Determine the scope of changes

Learn more about [conventional commits format](/docs/guides/conventional-commits).

### GitHub Integration

The GitHub integration provides rich context:

- **Author attribution**: See who made each change
- **Commit links**: Jump directly to the commit on GitHub
- **Repository metadata**: Accurate project information

While GitHub is currently required, support for other platforms is planned.

## Benefits

By automating the changelog generation process, Nyron:

- ✅ Saves time on manual changelog writing
- ✅ Ensures consistency across releases
- ✅ Reduces human error in version management
- ✅ Keeps your team focused on building features
