# Workflow

Here's a typical end-to-end versioning workflow using Nyron, from checking changes to creating a release.

## Complete Release Workflow

### 1. Bump version and generate changelog

Start by bumping the version and generating a changelog:

```bash
npx @nyron/cli bump --type minor --prefix v
```

This will:
- Increment the version number
- Generate a changelog based on your commits
- Update your `package.json` file
- Create metadata in the `.nyron/` directory

### 2. Review the changes

Check the generated changelog and version changes to make sure everything looks correct.

### 3. Commit the changes

Commit the version bump and changelog updates:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.0"
```

### 4. Create and push nyron-release tag

Create a nyron-release tag that triggers the release workflow:

```bash
npx @nyron/cli push-tag
```

This creates and pushes a tag like `nyron-release@2024-01-15@14-30-25.123`.

### 5. Create GitHub release

Generate the GitHub release with auto-generated changelog:

```bash
npx @nyron/cli release
```

This will:
- Find commits since the last nyron-release tag
- Generate a changelog from conventional commits
- Create a GitHub release with the changelog

### 6. Push your commits

Finally, push your version bump commits:

```bash
git push
```

## Monorepo Workflow

For monorepos with multiple packages, the workflow is the same but you specify which package to release:

```bash
# Bump specific package
npx @nyron/cli bump --type patch --prefix @myapp/api@

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "chore(api): bump version to 1.0.1"

# Create nyron-release tag
npx @nyron/cli push-tag

# Create GitHub release
npx @nyron/cli release

# Push commits
git push
```

## Version Bump Decision Guide

Choose the appropriate bump type based on your changes:

### Major (`--type major`)

Use for breaking changes that require users to update their code:

- API changes that break compatibility
- Removal of deprecated features
- Major architectural changes

Example: `1.5.2` → `2.0.0`

### Minor (`--type minor`)

Use for new features that are backward compatible:

- New functionality
- New API endpoints
- Feature enhancements

Example: `1.5.2` → `1.6.0`

### Patch (`--type patch`)

Use for bug fixes and minor updates:

- Bug fixes
- Documentation updates
- Performance improvements (non-breaking)

Example: `1.5.2` → `1.5.3`

## Pro Tips

### Use the reminder feature

If you have `onPushReminder: true` in your config, Nyron will remind you to push your tags after creating them.

### Preview releases

You can preview what will be included in a release using the dry-run flag:

```bash
npx @nyron/cli release --dry-run
```

### Consistent commit messages

The better your commit messages follow [conventional commits](/docs/guides/conventional-commits), the better your changelog will look.

### Automate with CI/CD

You can integrate Nyron into your CI/CD pipeline to automate releases on merge to main or when specific tags are created.

### Configure GitHub repository settings

For the best experience with Nyron, configure your GitHub repository to enforce clean commit history and conventional commit format. See the [GitHub repository setup guide](/docs/guides/conventional-commits#github-repository-setup) for detailed instructions.
