# Workflow

Here's a typical end-to-end versioning workflow using Nyron, from checking changes to creating a release.

## Complete Release Workflow

### 1. Check what's changed

First, review the commits since your last release:

```bash
npx @nyron/cli diff --prefix v
```

This shows you:
- What features were added
- What bugs were fixed
- What maintenance work was done

Use this to decide on the type of version bump (major, minor, or patch).

### 2. Bump version and generate changelog

Once you've decided on the version type, run:

```bash
npx @nyron/cli bump --type minor --prefix v
```

This will:
- Increment the version number
- Generate a changelog based on your commits
- Update your `package.json` file

### 3. Review the changes

Check the generated changelog and version changes to make sure everything looks correct.

### 4. Commit the changes

Commit the version bump and changelog updates:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "chore: bump version to 1.2.0"
```

### 5. Create and push the tag

Create a git tag for the release:

```bash
npx @nyron/cli tag --prefix v --version 1.2.0
```

### 6. Push everything

Push your commits and tags to the remote repository:

```bash
git push && git push --tags
```

## Monorepo Workflow

For monorepos with multiple packages, the workflow is similar but you specify which package to release:

```bash
# Check changes for a specific package
npx @nyron/cli diff --prefix @myapp/api@

# Bump that package
npx @nyron/cli bump --type patch --prefix @myapp/api@

# Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "chore(api): bump version to 1.0.1"

# Tag the release
npx @nyron/cli tag --prefix @myapp/api@ --version 1.0.1

# Push
git push && git push --tags
```

## Version Bump Decision Guide

Choose the appropriate bump type based on your changes:

### Major (`--type major`)

Use for breaking changes that require users to update their code:

- API changes that break compatibility
- Removal of deprecated features
- Major architectural changes

Example: `1.5.2` → `2.0.0`

### Minor (`--type minor`)

Use for new features that are backward compatible:

- New functionality
- New API endpoints
- Feature enhancements

Example: `1.5.2` → `1.6.0`

### Patch (`--type patch`)

Use for bug fixes and minor updates:

- Bug fixes
- Documentation updates
- Performance improvements (non-breaking)

Example: `1.5.2` → `1.5.3`

## Pro Tips

### Use the reminder feature

If you have `onPushReminder: true` in your config, Nyron will remind you to push your tags after creating them.

### Preview before bumping

Always run `nyron diff` first to see what will be included in the changelog.

### Consistent commit messages

The better your commit messages follow [conventional commits](/docs/guides/conventional-commits), the better your changelog will look.

### Automate with CI/CD

You can integrate Nyron into your CI/CD pipeline to automate releases on merge to main or when specific tags are created.
