# Nyron

**The easiest way to start versioning.**

Current versioning tools are slow, ritualistic, and break your flow. Nyron automates changelogs, tagging, and releases—powered by your commits, not ceremony. Stay focused on building; Nyron handles the order.

## Why Nyron?

Stop wrestling with manual changelog updates, version bumps, and tag management. If you're writing [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) (and you should be), Nyron extracts **exactly what you did** and organizes it for you:

- ✅ **Automatic changelog generation** from your commit history
- ✅ **Smart commit grouping** (Features, Bug Fixes, Chores, etc.)
- ✅ **Multi-package support** for monorepos
- ✅ **GitHub integration** for author attribution and commit links
- ✅ **Zero configuration overhead** to get started

Nyron requires GitHub as the source of truth for your repository metadata and commit information. A GitHub token is required for all operations.

**Pro tip:** Configure your GitHub repository with squash merging and conventional commit enforcement for the best experience. Learn more in the [repository setup guide](/docs/guides/conventional-commits#github-repository-setup).
